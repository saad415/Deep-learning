# Deep Learning (Projects)
This project focuses on Learnnin deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to classify images of cats and dogs. The project includes data augmentation to enhance the training dataset and improve model performance. Additionally, we employ Support Vector Machines (SVM) to further enhance the classification accuracy.

# Sentiment Analysis
sentiment analysis project leverages various data preprocessing techniques, text vectorization methods, and deep learning architectures to classify the sentiment of textual data into positive, negative, or neutral categories. It employs technologies like one-hot encoding, tokenization, LSTM, CNN, and more, to build and fine-tune sentiment classification models. The project's end-to-end pipeline encompasses data preparation, model training, evaluation, and the potential for deployment in applications like social media monitoring and customer feedback analysis, making it a valuable tool for understanding and interpreting textual sentiment in a wide range of contexts.

## Introduction

In this project, we explore deep learning techniques to classify images of cats and dogs. We make use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and apply data augmentation to enhance the training dataset. Additionally, we leverage Support Vector Machines (SVM) to improve classification accuracy.

## Data Preprocessing and Conv2D

In this initial phase, we preprocess the dataset, which includes images of cats and dogs. Data augmentation techniques are applied to increase the diversity of the training dataset. These techniques include random rotation, flipping, and resizing. The goal is to ensure that the model generalizes well to various image conditions.

We implement Conv2D layers in the CNN model to extract features from the images effectively. Conv2D layers apply convolution operations to capture patterns and structures within the images.

## Trained CNN Model

After training the CNN model on the preprocessed dataset, we save the trained model as `model_rcat_dog.h5`. This model can be reused to make predictions on new images of cats and dogs.

## Model Predictions

The trained CNN model can predict whether an uploaded image contains a cat or a dog. This classification is achieved through the use of binary classification techniques. The model assigns a probability score to each class (cat and dog) and selects the class with the highest probability as the prediction.

## Usage

To run this project, you need to have Python and the required libraries installed. You can follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the project using `python main.py`.

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with different images to see how well the model performs in classifying cats and dogs.
